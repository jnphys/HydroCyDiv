# Analysis and Fitting of Jefferys Model
This folder contains the main code for analyzing and fitting Jefferys model to the pulling and release phases of tracks to obtain viscoelastic parameters. Additionally, it includes two functions:

**importTrackMateTracks:** This function loads the beads trajectories pulled by magnetic tweezers in XML format, exported by TrackMate.

**trackSelection:** This function allows selecting the proper track for analysis by clicking at one of its ends.

These scripts are part of a project aimed at understanding the viscoelastic properties of sea urchin cytoplasm using experimental data obtained from magnetic tweezers experiments.
