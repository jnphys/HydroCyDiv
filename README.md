# Hydrodynamics of Cytoplasm during cell Division 
This repository is for analyzing experimental data of sea urchin embryos during the early stages of cell division, developed by Javad Najafi in Minc Lab at Institut Jacques Monod (IJM). 

## Overview
The repository contains some representative codes customized for analyzing various aspects of sea urchin embryology experiments. However, they can be used for similar cases after some modifications. The projects covered include:

**Magnet Calibration:** Finding the magnet calibration equation using the trajectories of magnetic beads displaced through a test viscous fluid.\
**Cytoplasm Viscoelasticity Analysis:** Investigating cytoplasm viscoelasticity by pulling magnetic beads inside the cytoplasm.\
**Endomembrane Trafficking Force Analysis:** Estimating the force exerted on microtubule aster during centration by endomembrane trafficking.\
**Cytoplasm Flow Analysis:** Analyzing cytoplasm flow inside the region of interest and generating flow maps and streamlines of velocity.

## Contents
Each project is organized into its respective folder and includes the following components:

**Scripts:** Contains the MATLAB main script and functions used for data analysis.\
**Representative Data:** Sample experimental data relevant to the project.\
**Script Outputs:** Output generated by running the scripts on the representative data.

Do not hesitate to explore each folder to gain insights into data analysis methodologies and each project's findings.
