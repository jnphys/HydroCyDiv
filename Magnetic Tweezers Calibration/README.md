# Magnet Tweezers Calibration Equation
This folder contains the codes necessary for obtaining the magnet calibration equation. The scripts provided enable the selection of pulled bead trajectories for analysis, and the fit parameters are obtained through optimization methods.

**importTrackMateTracks:** This function loads bead trajectories exported by TrackMate for further processing and analysis.
