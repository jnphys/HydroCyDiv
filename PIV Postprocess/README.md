# Velocity Evolution in ROI and Flowmaps
This folder contains a code designed for averaging the velocity components within a drawn region of interest (ROI) to track its temporal evolution. Additionally,
it generates a heatmap and streamlines of the flow field.

**Note:** The representative folder does not include the exported files by PIVlab due to the GitHub file size limit. However, this file can be found in this
