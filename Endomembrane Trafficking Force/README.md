# Endomembrane Trafficking Analysis
This folder contains codes for loading TrackMate files in XML format and analyzing endomembrane trafficking to primarily estimate the exerted force by the vesicle movement on the centering aster. 
The trajectory of the aster is also needed for the analysis to rotate the coordinate system appropriately and find the distances between the aster and vesicles.
*This project is still ongoing, and most of the evaluations are performed as exploratory data analysis to gain further statistics and insights about the aster centration process.*

There is a folder containing example tracks of endosomes in XML and the aster in CSV format.

**Note:** Exporting some parts of the results as an Excel file might not be compatible with Linux and macOS systems.
